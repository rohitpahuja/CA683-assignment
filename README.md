## Data
Github limits individual files to 100 mb, hence the data csv cannot be commited to the repo.
Please download the csv from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud to the data directoty at the root of the repository. 
Keep filename as creditcard.csv and make all code references accordingly, i.e. $PROJECT_PATH/data/creditcard.csv
